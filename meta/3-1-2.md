Data on the percentage of maternities taking place in medical facilities are being reported as an approximation of the UN Global Indicator as this is the most relevant currently available data in the UK. The majority of maternities in the UK take place in NHS or non-NHS establishments, that will have skilled health personnel present. The small number of maternities that occur 'at home' or 'elsewhere' may also have skilled health personnel present, but this is not currently recorded in the data.
* Maternities 'at home': Home births could have a skilled health professional present (a midwife) on many occasions as some women choose to have a home birth, and a midwife attends. There will be some home births which occur without a midwife but an ambulance is sent and arrives just before or soon after the birth (these are births which happen too quickly for the mother to get to hospital). 
* Maternities that occur 'Elsewhere': Births that fall into the 'elsewhere' category for place of occurrence include those that occur on the way to hospital e.g. in an ambulance where a medical professional could have been present.<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[3.1.2 Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (CSV 10.219 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/3-1-2.csv)
