data_footnote: >-
  As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be
  periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 
  2015, when the World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line
  using the 2011 PPP. Prior to
  that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP.
