  A framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and
  6.3.1. Presence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. At present, UK data does not account for homeless rough sleepers. Data follows the UN
  specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
